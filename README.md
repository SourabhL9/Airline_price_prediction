Project Title: Airline-price-prediction
Objective : The project was undertaken to predict the price of Airline travel.
Description : 
This is a Regression task.
Dataset contained these features: airline, source, destination, route, departure time, arrival time, total duration etc. preprocessing was done according to the need to clean the data and some conversions were performed on the features to get the data in numerical form to analyse

ML algorithms applied: Decision tree and Random Forest.
Post applying the models, random forest was used to predict the prices on live data.

Quick insights for reference:
model comparing: from applying both the algorithms decision tree and random forest, random forest gave the higher accuracy compared to decision tree. The reason for better accuracy in RF is that multiple trees were built for predicting the accuracy and all variables were given the chance to split. Random forest is used in predicting the live data.
Below questions are answered as an additional pointer.
•	Checking Which airline is most preferred airline
•	Finding the majority of the flights take off from which source
•	maximum flights land in which destination
•	Checking the average price of the flights

Please refer the python code file. Analysis and insights gained from the respective data are well listed in the code file.

Thank you.
